NLP - Natural Lenguage Processing

Week 1 - Language Terminology + preprocessing techniques
	Start before ML: There's a course Speech and Language Proccessing Standford
		Watch YouTube Playlist up to 2.5
		State of Language Technology
			Mostly solved:
				- spam detection
				- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
				- Named entity recognition (NER)
			Making good progress
				- Sentiment analysis
				- Coreference resolution 
				- Word sense disambiguation (WSD) "mouse" PC|animal
				- Parsing 
				- Machine translation (MT)
				- Information Extraction (IE)
			Still really hard
				- Question answering (QA)
				- Paraphrase
				- Summarization
				- Dialog
		In this class
			Teaches key theory and methods for statistical NLP:
				Viterbi
				Na√Øve Bayes, Maxent classifiers
				N-gram language modeling
				Statistical Parsing
				Inverted index, tf-idf, vector models of meaning
			For practical, robust real-world applications
				Information extraction
				Spelling correction
				Information retrieval
		Text processing
			Regular expressions (Most basic)
